Develop a Python program that reads a sequence of non-negative integers between 1 and 10,000 from a file "input.txt" and prints the expansion of each number in reverse order in base (radix) 10. 

You must use functions in your program as follows:

A function "read_input()" with no arguments to read the input from the file.

A function "expand(m)" that takes an integer m as argument (parameter) and displays the expansion of m in reverse order in base (radix) 10.

The main program should call the above two functions appropriately to get the task completed.

Note that you should call expand(i) from the main program for each integer i in the input list, and you could do this in a loop.

You may define other functions in your program. The input file "input.txt" contains the list of integers in a single line, separated by space. The output (expansion) for each number should be on a separate line.


Sample input (in the input file): 
4937 35 628

Output: 
4937 = 7*1 + 3*10 + 9*100 + 4*1000
35 = 5*1 + 3*10
628 = 8*1 + 2*10 + 6*100
